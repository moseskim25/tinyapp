# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

The main URLs page displays all the urls associated with the registered user. Each url comes with it's own shortened URL which you can use to access the web page.
